        Milestone 2:
Conduct survey across various audiences to inform your predictions
​
Milestone 2 Tasks and Activities:
Challenges in today's education system: Conduct a survey to identify challenges in today's education system. If you could have power to change any one thing, what would that be?
Define who's the right audience for the survey (e.g., teachers, parents, administration, all of the above)
Think about how will the input from each of the groups influence your analysis
​Develop initial list of need to know questions
In your survey, include questions around your ideas and test the feedback from the audience
Conduct survey, collect and analyze responses
​Content:
Surveys & Samples
Survey Research Methods
Designing & Conducting surveys
Examples of initial need to know
Bias in survey sampling
Are students receiving education that they desire? Is there content that students have interest for, but it's not supplied by teachers / schools? Conduct a survey among school students, in various age groups, to understand frustrations that they face and what would they like to change
Use the steps outlined in the previous task to conduct survey (define your audience, draft questions, conduct survey, collect & analyze results)
Compare your surveys and think about how the responses from teachers and administration are different from the responses from students. Do teachers see the same problems / gaps as students? Do students accept the gaps, identified by teachers and administration as true gaps?
Summarize your analysis in a short write-up (use PowerPoint or Word)​​​​
