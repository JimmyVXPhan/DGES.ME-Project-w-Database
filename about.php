    <h3>Every child deserves a quality education!</h3>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">Unfortunately, my home country of Georgia, a small post-soviet developing country, has little to offer to its children. The schools are either private and expensive, so only the top 1% of the population can afford it, or they are public and the teachers are from the soviet-regime, with a mindset pretty closely aligned to communist principles. Obviously, there are exceptions, but, sadly, few and far between. Out of 550,000 students that go to school, 510,000 attend public schools (according to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.skolebi.com" target="_blank" data-content="http://www.skolebi.com" data-type="external">www.skolebi.com</a></span>). &nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">Due to the lack of education, Georgia struggles to prosper. The number of Georgians pursuing degrees in education has dropped by 50% since 2007, while graduation rates have dropped by 90%, in the same time period. Based on the data provided by <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.GeoStat.ge" target="_blank" data-content="http://www.GeoStat.ge" data-type="external">GeoStat.ge</a></span>, in the capital city, Tbilisi, every year only ~600 new kids enter school, while the birth rates are at 15,000, that's only 4%! The top talent thatâ€™s able to distinguish themselves in these conditions, typically moves out of the country, in search of a better education and better opportunities. As a result, there is lack of growth and innovation in the Georgian economy. Due to the influence of church and soviet teachers, kids grow up without respect for minority groups, such as LGBTQ, or people of different skin-colors. They lack access to new and current information and most of the material they have access to either flows through Facebook&nbsp;or is being fed by the Russian government.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">I aspire to change all that! I have passion to strengthen the foundation, equip kids with better education to create a truly democratic, independent, and strong country. With better education, children will be open to the options that exist, rather than being limited to what they see or what gets communicated to them from their parents, grandparents or teachers. Knowing what the options are and with innovative, fun, gamified curriculum, I will strive to instill passion in them to learn, challenge the status quo and fight for a better future.</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="font_8"><span class="color_26">Unfortunately, I can't do this independently. I need support to drive this effort, to recruit people from all over the world to create curriculum and content that will support the idea of innovative, gamified, project-based learning. I need to hire developers to develop a platform that will reach kids even in rural communities. I will need to invest in technology to give access to students in rural economies to the educational platform and latest content. I will leverage my expertise from Consulting and my passion for this project to influence the direction of this project, to bring people with a similar mindset together and drive the change. For those interested to participate, please contact me at <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="mailto:support@dges.me" target="_self" data-content="support@dges.me" data-type="mail">support@dges.me</a></span>. Help me lead this change and influence the lives of hundreds of thousands of children, who will in turn make their mark on the global economy.&nbsp;</span></p>
